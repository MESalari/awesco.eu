To be competitive with other renewable energy technologies, robust automatic operation throughout every phase of flight is of paramount importance for AWE systems. The objective of this project is to develop control strategies for reliable operation under realistic environmental conditions. Two different aspects of operation are considered within the scope of this project. Firstly, a control strategy for reliable launching and landing of kite power systems based on flexible wings has been developed. The results show how the kite can be launched under different wind conditions using a separate multicopter system. The landing itself can be accomplished using the winch control system without further external assistance. Secondly, a modular control architecture for rigid wing kite power systems. As a result of the modular architecture, the controller can be partially or as a whole implemented in existing prototypes. The results show that the developed control strategy can ensure reliable operation in a turbulent wind field. Industrial as well as academic collaborations within the AWESCO project have contributed to this project.
