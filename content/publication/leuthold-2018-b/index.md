abstract: "For classical horizontal axis wind turbines, there are many available ’engineering models’ that describe the
relationship between unsteady induction factors and the nondimensional parameters describing the turbine’s performance,
such as thrust coefficient. There is, as of yet, no such simple unsteady actuator annulus relationship
suitable for multiple-kite airborne wind energy systems (MAWES). This work approximates such a relationship
from the Biot-Savart integral of a frozen, periodic vortex tube representing the geometry of a simplified pumpingcycle
MAWES. A comparison is made between the behavior of a MAWES as predicted with this new actuator
annulus relationship and with the classic Pitt-Peters model."
