  abstract = {In this work, a novel vertical takeoff and landing methodology for flexible wing kite power systems is presented Starting from a basic mast-based launching and landing concept, the operational envelope will be enlarged using the external assistance of a multicopter The multicopter is used to drag the kite along a specified launching path until the operational altitude is reached, where the kite is detached and steered to its characteristic parking position while the multicopter lands The landing of the kite will be conducted without multicopter assistance, and solely the winch will be used to pull the kite toward the ground station For all maneuvers, flight control algorithms are presented, and the feasibility of the proposed methodology is analyzed using a developed simulation environment incorporating models for the kite, multicopter, ground station, and the tethers that connect the individual subsystems},

  abstract  = {Airborne  wind  energy  (AWE)  is  a  concept  for  harvesting  wind  energy  using  tethered  flying  devices  Compared  toconventional wind turbines AWE systems require substantially less support structures like a tower  The replacementof towers by tethers also allow accessing higher altitudes where winds blow stronger and more persistent  Severalconfigurations are currently pursued  Electricity can be generated with on-board propellers which are driven by the airflow and the power is transmitted to the ground through a conducting tether Another configuration is the pumping cyclein which case the kite flies crosswind to pull a tether that is unreeled as it moves a ground-based electrical generator, anda retraction phase when the kite is reeled in Next to electricity generation AWE can also be used for ship propulsion We consider a single cell of a ram-air wing in our study which is based on an inflatable double skin design  Ram-air wings are inflated by the stagnation pressure entering through inlets at the leading edge The internalpressure provides structural stability and stiffness  The fully or partially inflated structure is flexible and can thereforeexhibit large deformations during flight  This introduces a strong coupling between the structure and the air flow sincethe internal pressure in dependent on the wind speed, and a deformed kite will inevitably have a different pressure fieldcaused by the flow compared to an un-deformed kite Also, bridle system induces a significant additional drag to the wingdrag and therefore the kites fly with high angle of attack to obtain high lift and to ultimately maximise power output Highangles of attack causes the flow to separate which cannot be simulated with fast inviscid methods and therefore a CFDanalysis tool such as OpenFOAM is requiredThe main challenge in analysis and design of these kites is the governing fluid-structure interaction (FSI) mechanism,which leads to a drastic increase in model complexity On the other hand utilising FSI is crucial to obtain reliable results on  performance  measures  and  structural  integrity   We  follow  the  partitioned  coupling  approach,  where  the  fluid  andstructure domains are solved individually and coupled at their interface In this work we couple OpenFOAM with ourfinite element (FE) solver mem4pyby using the coupling tool preCICE The coupled solver is then used to simulate asingle ram-air wing section (cell) and its change in aerodynamic performance due to deformation},

The lift-to-drag ratio is mainly affected by the power setting or trim of the kite and the steering commands For the first time the effect of the trim control on the kite's steering capability was quantified for a leading edge inflatable kite We found that a trim position with higher power ratio which results in a higher angle of attack increases the steering agility of the kite The attained yaw rate increased by 40% For optimization of future power kites it is important to understand the mechanisms affecting a kite's performance},

  abstract = {Kite power is a novel way of producing wind energy. One possible implementation uses the traction force of a fast-flying kite to drive a stationary generator on the ground. This concept aims at reducing the cost of energy produced by conventional wind turbines. There are however several technical challenges to overcome to develop kite power technology on a large scale. One of them arises from the light weight and flexible nature of the inflatable kite. This yields a tight coupling between the kite's aero- and structural-dynamics, which is particularly critical when launching and retrieving the system. Computer models capable of predicting these interactions are at an early stage of development. This paper presents the grounds of an ongoing research project, which aims at computationally modelling fluid--structure interactions for kite power systems .},

The analytical solutions allow for an (almost) instantaneous selection and computation of actual operation strategy and corresponding reference currents. Numerical methods (approximating these solutions only) are no longer required. The unified theory is based on one simple idea: all optimisation problems, their respective constraints and the computation of the intersection point(s) of voltage ellipse, current circle or torque, MTPC, MTPV, MTPF hyperbolas are reformulated implicitly as quadrics which allows to invoke the Lagrangian formalism and to find the roots of fourth-order polynomials analytically. The proposed theory is suitable for any anisotropic synchronous machine. Implementation and measurement results illustrate effectiveness and applicability of the theoretical findings in real world.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a computationally efficient Predictive Torque Control (PTC) technique for permanent-magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) without weighting factors. The proposed control strategy is based on computing the q-axis reference current from the demanded torque. Furthermore, the d-axis reference current is set to zero to achieve the maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) operation of the PMSG. Then, the reference voltage vector (VV) is directly computed from the reference current vector using the deadbeat principle. Finally, according to the location of this reference VV, only three evaluations of the cost function are required. The cost function includes only the error between the reference VV and the candidates ones, which eliminates the need of weighting factors. Therefore, the proposed control scheme overcomes the following drawbacks of the classical PTC: 1) High calculation burden, and 2) tuning of the weighting factors. Experimental results using a dSPACE DS1007 realtime platform and a 14.5 kW PMSG are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed control method.},

However, limited attention was given on how to effectively compute, simulate and compare the expected (i.e. simulated) and the practically applied electromechanical torque. This requires an accurate electromechanical model with precise electromechanical torque estimation. This paper presents a high fidelity direct-quadrature (dq) model capable of describing the generated electromechanical torque. The presented method is based on obtaining the non-linear flux linkage maps as well as describing the harmonic models, which contribute to the average and ripple torque, respectively. The flux linkage maps contribute in the tuning of the stator current controllers and electromechanical torque computation, which is compared to the computed torque from the manufacturer parameters and literature. The proposed model does not require previous knowledge concerning geometric and machine design data.

  abstract  = {Space-vector PWM (SVPWM) gained attention, as a voltage synthesis technique for asymmetrical dual three phase machines (ADTMs); due to its ability to minimize the harmonic content of the output and minimize the switching losses through proper selection of the switching vectors. It has been studied extensively for ADTMs mainly for induction machines with isolated neutrals (2N), such that the inverter is assumed to be the only source capable of inducing harmonics within the stator currents. Thus, by setting the xy subspace voltages to zero, the harmonic content is minimized. However, for dual three phase-permanent magnet synchronous machines (DT-PMSM), the presence of non-sinusoidal rotor flux invokes significant harmonics, mandating non-zero references for the xy plane to ensure proper compensation. This paper invokes the employment of non-zero harmonic references within the SVPWM calculation for the 2N connection, as well as laying out the fundamentals for the single neutral (1N) connection, which is more reliable from fault-tolerance point of view. Also, a simple digital realization is presented, suitable for the 12-, 24-sector SVPWM methods, both continuous and discontinuous modulations. The theoretical findings are corroborated with a 4.4 kW DT-PMSM, demonstrating significant improvement in the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the stator currents.},

Then, the location of this reference VV is identified based on its angle. Finally, a certain cost function is evaluated for only three times to get the optimal voltage vector to be applied in the next sampling instant. However, the proposed DMPCC is a model-based control system, and accordingly, sensitive to parameter variations of the PMSG. To mitigate such limitation, a simple observer is designed to enhance the robustness of the proposed DMPCC scheme to variations of the PMSG parameters. The proposed DMPCC strategy has been experimentally implemented and its performance has been compared with that of the conventional DMPCC.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an Optimal Control Problem (OCP) tailored to assess the system performance of a rigid wing Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) pumping system prior to real flight tests. The proposed method is validated against experimental data obtained using a small prototype designed by the Dutch company Ampyx Power B.V. Within such analysis, it is shown that a non-optimized closed-loop flight control system can generate power to within 10% of the open-loop optimal flight trajectories. Additionally, results demonstrate that the system efficiency does not depend on the trajectory topology, though a significant change in terms of trajectory shape is observed for different wind speeds as a result of trajectory constraints.},

  abstract  = {Airborne wind energy is an emerging technology that is capable of harvesting wind energy by flying crosswind flight patterns with a tethered aircraft. Several companies are trying to scale-up their concept in order to be competitive in the energy market. However, the scaling process requires numerous iterations and trade-offs among the different components in terms of requirements that have to satisfy both technological and economical viability. In this paper, we show how to deal with this task by means of an optimal control approach combined with statistical analysis based on the established methods for conventional Wind Energy Conversion Systems. This approach is applied to a rigid wing pumping mode AWE System built by Ampyx Power B.V.},
