The 8th International Airborne Wind Energy Conference will be held at the Technology & Innovation Centre (TIC) of the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow. The event is jointly organized by the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk), [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl) and the new industry association [Airborne Wind Europe](http://www.airbornewindeurope.org). Interested presenters can submit one-page abstracts in English until 4 June 2019 by email to [info@awec2019.com](mailto:info@awec2019.com). The received abstracts will be evaluated by the [program committee](https://awec2019.com/committee) and additional invited reviewers, all internationally renowned AWE experts. Following this peer review, authors are notified about acceptance and invited to compile a final version of their abstract. This will be included in the book of abstracts which will be available in open access and distributed at the conference. The existing book series can be accessed from the [conference website](https://awec2019.com): [{{< figure src="boas.jpg" >}}](https://awec2019.com/book-of-abstracts-series)
