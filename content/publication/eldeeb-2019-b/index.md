abstract: "Without prior knowledge of the geometric and design data of the employed asymmetrical dual three-phase interior permanent magnet synchronous machine (ADT-IPMSM), this paper proposes effective fundamental and enhanced harmonic models along with parameter identification for the different subspaces and with different neutral point configurations. The cross coupling between the coordinates of the different subspaces is also taken into account. The proposed method is based on simple experimental tests that can be applied to any ADT-IPMSMs. The performed computer simulations coincide to a high extent with experimental validations on a 2.5-kW ADT-IPMSM prototype."
