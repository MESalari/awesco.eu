The modeling of airborne wind energy (AWE) systems and the study of the role of the AWE
technology in the future energy system is crucial for its early-stage development. The main work
performed by ESR05 has been the development of a mathematical model and power optimization
problem for AWE systems, with the aim of studying the integration of AWE in the power system.

This report contains the description of the work carried out by the ESR05 at Chalmers University of
Technology. As described in detail in the report, a mathematical model of an AWE system has been
developed and implemented in an optimal control framework with the aim of optimizing the flight
trajectory in order to maximize the average power generation. The model has been validated with
flight data against the Ampyx Power AP2 prototype and further used to study the AWE performance
of controlled trajectory in wind farms.

In order to investigate the integration of AWE into future energy systems, real wind data have been
gathered from the NASA global wind database. The wind data have been implemented in the optimal
control framework in order to investigate the annual hourly energy production at specific locations.
The ESR has started comparing AWE and traditional wind turbines in terms of annual energy
production, availability and downtime. Further, the levelized cost of energy will be studied
compared to other renewable energy technologies, in order to evaluate the role of AWE systems in
the future energy mix.
