Rachel Leuthold is Marie-Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellow working on optimal control of a centrifugally stiffened rotor in pumping cycle operation. She obtained an MSc in Aerospace Engineering from the Technical University of Delft (Netherlands) in 2015, with a thesis on a multiple wake vortex lattice method for membrane-wing kites. She graduated with a BSc in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (USA) in 2011.
