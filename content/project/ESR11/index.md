Ampyx Power is developing a large scale airborne wind energy system. Currently a 30kW prototype is
being tested and software algorithm are improved while a 200kW prototype is being built. A target
2MW system is in planning. For the 200kW system a new launching and landing system is in
development and currently in the design stage. The automation of launching and landing poses a
hard challenge because the complexity of the launching and landing system and the requirement of
being able to launch and land safely within a limited area. The ESR09 supports the design of the
launching and landing system and the power generation system with the development of computer
algorithms that are able to optimize flight trajectories for the airborne wind energy system.

Arresting of the airborne part of an Airborne Wing Energy System (AWES) safely and reliably on the
ground, especially when the airborne part is a rigid winged aircraft is a key challenge faced by
Airborne Wing Energy (AWE) developers. During a year-long fellowship, the Early Stage Researcher
(ESR) was tasked with investigating suitable stopping/arresting mechanisms for Ampyx Power’s precommercial
prototype, AP-3. An arresting hook is proposed together with the ground-based arresting
lines to achieve rapid deceleration within a limited landing distance as the solution for AP-3 due to
the many advantages it has over other types of arresting mechanisms.
The AP-3 arresting hook is designed to catch an arresting line after touching down while rolling on
the ground, level and steady after touch down, before engaging an arresting line. The arresting hook
mount location is decided based on airframe strong points as well as the consequences of the
arresting load transference to the aircraft’s stability and structural integrity.
The arresting hook system comprises of sub components similar to a typical aviation arresting hook
designed with care to overcome the unique operational challenges of an AWES. Understanding the
states of the hook mechanism is critical for system design and breaking down the operation to these
states allow the determination of load cases associated with the mechanism.
Many valuable lessons were learnt following the completion of the scope covering aspects such as
codes and standards, scientific design methods, system engineering methods, materials and
fabrication, costs and scope and time managment.
During the year long fellowship, the ESR did not produce any publication, due to time restaints.
ESR15 participated in a number of training programs organised by AWESCO and Ampyx Power during
the fellowship.
