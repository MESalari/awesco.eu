abstract: "Multiple-kite Airborne Wind Energy Systems (MAWES) aim to decrease inter-mittency and cost over conventional wind turbines, while generating more power than other airborne wind energy systems The purpose of this work is to estimate whether axial and angular induction are relevant phenomena in the modelling of pumping-cycle MAWES with two or more kites Considering the modelling assumptions, axial induction is a relevant phenomenon and leads to significant changes in design-point, especially with respect to kite mass and secondary tether length However, angular induction can be neglected in modelling for optimal design and control problems"
