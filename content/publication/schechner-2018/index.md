abstract: "During pumping mode, airborne wind energy systems are operated in two
phases: A power generating reel-out phase and a power dissipating reel-in phase.
The ground winch is connected via a DC-link voltage source converter to the grid.
The control of its DC-link voltage is a challenging task due to the bidirectional
power flow over the DC-link. Two PI controller designs are discussed: the classical
PI controller with constant parameters and a nonlinear PI controller with online
parameter adjustment. Based on a worst-case analysis of the physical properties,
bounds on the constant parameters of the classical PI controller are derived leading
to a conservative design to assure a stable operation also during the reel-in phase
where the system dynamics are non-minimum phase. To overcome these limitations
in the closed-loop bandwidth, a nonlinear PI controller is proposed which adjusts its
parameters online. For controller design, the linearized system model is used and the
controller parameters are computed via “online pole placement”. Simulation results
illustrate robustness, stability and improved control performance of the proposed
nonlinear PI controller in comparison to the classical PI controller."
