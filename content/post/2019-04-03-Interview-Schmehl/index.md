The EU Horizon 2020 projects [AWESCO](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/193938/factsheet/en) (Airborne Wind Energy System Modelling, Control and Optimisation) and [REACH](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/199241/factsheet/en) (Resource Efficient Automatic Conversion of High-Altitude Wind) have been running in parallel and have both addressed technical challenges of airborne wind energy. On the other hand, the two projects are also fundamentally different: AWESCO is an [Initial Training Network (ITN)](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/research-networks_en), focusing on research and doctoral education, whereas REACH is a [Fast Track to Innovation (FTI)](https://ec.europa.eu/easme/en/eic-fast-track-innovation-fti-0) project, focusing the development of on innovative technology. But most importantly, the two projects perfectly complement each other in a perfect way - thinks Roland Schmehl, the coordinator of the two projects.
