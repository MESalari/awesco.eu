abstract: "Crosswind kite power is a promising alternative wind power technology. However, unlike the rotor blades of a conventional wind turbine, a kite needs to be launched prior to power generation and needs to be landed during low-wind conditions or for maintenance. This study proposes multicopter-based concepts for an autonomous solution. Basic system components and different system configurations are discussed. Static and dynamic feasibility analyses are carried out. Results show that such systems are feasible and have advantages compared to other launching and landing concepts. However, also the weaknesses of such systems become apparent e.g. the increased airborne mass."
