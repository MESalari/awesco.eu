The electrical drive, to which the rigid/soft kite is coupled, is of pivotal importance; since it
controls the electromechanical energy conversion. ESR07 is responsible of specifying and modelling
the electrical drive of the AWE ground station. Furthermore, a robust and fault-tolerant controller
should be designed, analysed and implemented. In addition to that, during normal (healthy) operation,
the implemented controllers must ensure optimal and efficient operation to minimize the cost of kWh.

This report illustrates the work carried out by ESR07 in the attempt of accomplishing the assigned task
since the enrolment at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) on 01.09.2015 till terminating the
itinerary and transferring it to Munich University of Applied Sciences (MUAS) on 01.04.2018. As will be
shown later in this report, the proposed electrical drive and the employed controllers guarantee
significant efficiency enhancements and superior fault tolerance compared to the conventional drives
adopted by the industrial partners. Moreover, it removes one of the single-sources of electrical
failures. A test bench was specified and set up at the TUM/MUAS laboratory for the sake of validating
the carried-out theoretical analyses. The presented work was also a result of the collaborations with
the AWESCO industrial partners through secondments and external ones (as will be explained later in
this report).
