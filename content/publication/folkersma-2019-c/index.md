abstract: "Airborne wind energy (AWE) is a novel renewable energy technology for harvesting wind energy by using kites. Compared to conventional wind turbines, the AWE systems use a lightweight structure which can reach higher altitudes where the winds are stronger and more persistent. In this work, we study the steady-state aerodynamics of a ram-air kite section which is made of membranes. The inflatable structure of the kite is highly flexible and therefore exhibit a strong coupling between fluid and structure. An accurate aerodynamic model is essential to design a system which is both aerodynamically efficient and of high steering capability. The aerodynamic load distribution is calculated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) toolbox OpenFOAM with FOAM-FSI extension. The structural deformation is calculated with in-house mem4py finite element (FE) solver for membranes which uses dynamic relaxation method to find the steady-state shape. The two solvers are coupled with preCICE coupling tool."
