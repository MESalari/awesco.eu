Motion tracking and the estimation of the state of a manoeuvring kite is a crucial component for the
reliable and robust operation of airborne wind energy systems. The fast motions of the tethered kite
impose a challenge for state of the art estimation algorithms which is why ESR11 is responsible for
designing, analysing, and implementing optimisation-based moving horizon estimators.

This report illustrates the work carried out by ESR11 in the attempt of accomplishing the assigned task.
As will be shown later in this report, the developed moving horizon estimators for sensor fusion using
inertial sensors show a more robust estimation behaviour. Moreover, the developed algorithms are
particularly suited for online-calibration of the employed sensors and system parameters. The
additional computational complexity of the algorithm imposes a challenge for the real-time
implementation of moving horizon estimators on embedded systems with restricted computational
resources. First essential steps towards the full integration of optimisation-based estimators have been
taken, and the promising results will influence the design of the next generation of Xsens motion
trackers. The presented work is a result of both academic and industrial collaborations within the
AWESCO consortium.
