abstract: "In this work, we show how to couple OpenFOAM (foam-extend) and MBDyn software with the preCICE coupling tool to form a strongly coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) framework for membrane structures. We use an already existing preCICE adapter for foam-extend and we develop an adapter for MBDyn in this work. The coupled FSI framework is verified by carrying out a simulation on a modified cavity test case which has a flexible membrane at the bottom of the domain. The results are compared with the results of other authors. The solvers and the coupling tool are introduced here briefly."
