abstract: "In this paper, a small offshore airborne wind energy (AWE) farm consisting of three non-reversing pumping mode AWE systems is modelled and simulated. The AWE systems are interconnected using the direct interconnection technique. The quality of the generated power is analysed and investigated. Power control strategies are implemented and results discussed, with important implications for AWE power take-off designs."
