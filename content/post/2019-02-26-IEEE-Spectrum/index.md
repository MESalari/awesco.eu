The joint [publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2018.12.016) project of Gonzalo Sanchez-Arriaga, Alejandro Pastor-Rodriguez and Manuel Sanjurjo Rivo of Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and Roland Schmehl of TU Delft is featured in an IEEE Spectrum article contributed by Mark Anderson: [Ready Flyer One: Airborne Wind Energy Simulations Guide the Leap to Satisfying Global Energy Demand](https://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/renewables/ready-flyer-one-airborne-wind-energy-simulations-guide-the-leap-to-satisfying-global-energy-demand). The article focuses on the freely available [Lagrangian Kite Simulators (LaKSa)](https://github.com/apastor3/laksa) developed by the Spanish team and used for computational simulation at the TU Delft research group and the spin-off company [Kitepower](http://www.kitepower.nl).
