abstract: "Airborne wind energy (AWE) is a novel renewable energy technology for harvesting wind energyby using kites  Compared to conventional wind turbines, the AWE systems use a lightweightstructure which can reach higher altitudes where the winds are stronger and more persistentIn this work, we study the steady-state aerodynamics of a ram-air kite section which is made ofmembranes  The inflatable structure of the kite is highly flexible and therefore exhibit a strongcoupling between fluid and structure  An accurate aerodynamic model is essential to design asystem which is both aerodynamically efficient and of high steering capability  The aerodynamicload distribution is calculated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) toolbox OpenFOAMwith FOAM-FSI extension  The structural deformation is calculated with in-house mem4pyfinite  element  (FE)  solver  for  membranes  which  uses  dynamic  relaxation  method  to  find  thesteady-state shape  The two solvers are coupled with preCICE coupling tool"
