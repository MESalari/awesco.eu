## Guidelines for publication input

We use the academic admin tool for importing publications from a central bibliography file (bibliography.bib).

### What is working

* The publication abstract is imported via the bibtex field `abstract`.
* The month and year of the publication are imported via the fields `month` and `year`.

### What is not working

* Biblatex date format
* The files `cite.bib` need to be copied manually from the generated `*.bib` files.
* Project association: this would be a nice-to-have because then the generated publication information can be directly generated from the bib-file.
