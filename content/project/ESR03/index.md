Optimal control is one strategy to prepare for the preliminary design of multi-kite airborne wind
energy systems (MAWES). However, the solution of an optimal control problem (OCP) can only be as
good as the modeled physical constraints. This thesis intends to find a wake induction model that is
sufficiently fast to work in interactive numerical optimization, while being sufficiently accurate to give
meaningful OCP solutions. Work so far has determined that: a wake model is necessary, that the
model should be valid over applicable wind environments, that the model should include unsteady
effects. A fast wake model suitable for MAWES (an engineering induction model) has been proposed,
and work is ongoing to synthesize a model with a wider region of validity.
This report describes the work done over the course of the AWESCO ITN by ESR03, under the cosupervision
of Moritz Diehl (ALU-FR) and SÃ©bastien Gros (Chalmers). This work began on 01.01.2016,
and all relevant deliverables and milestones should be completed by 31.12.2018. This work was done
in collaboration with the other members of AWESCO, through collaborative paper-writing, joint
courses and workshops, as well as research secondments.
