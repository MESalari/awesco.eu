abstract: "The study proposes a new airborne wind energy system based on the
carousel concept. It comprises a rotary ring kite and a ground-based rotating reel
conversion system. The moment generated by the ring kite is transferred by several
peripheral tethers that connect to winch modules that are mounted on the ground
rotor. A generator is coupled to this rotor for direct electricity generation. Because
the ring kite is inclined with respect to the ground-rotor the length of the peripheral
tethers has to be adjusted continuously during operation. The proposed system is
designed to minimize the used land and space. This first study describes the fundamental
working principles, results of a small-scale experimental test, a kinematic
analysis of steady-state operation of the system and a power transmission analysis.
Design choices for the ring kite are discussed, a strategy for launching and landing
and methods for passive and active control are described."
