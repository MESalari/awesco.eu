  abstract = {In this work, a novel vertical takeoff and landing methodology for flexible wing kite power systems is presented. Starting from a basic mast-based launching and landing concept, the operational envelope will be enlarged using the external assistance of a multicopter. The multicopter is used to drag the kite along a specified launching path until the operational altitude is reached, where the kite is detached and steered to its characteristic parking position while the multicopter lands. The landing of the kite will be conducted without multicopter assistance, and solely the winch will be used to pull the kite toward the ground station. For all maneuvers, flight control algorithms are presented, and the feasibility of the proposed methodology is analyzed using a developed simulation environment incorporating models for the kite, multicopter, ground station, and the tethers that connect the individual subsystems.},

  abstract  = {Airborne  wind  energy  (AWE)  is  a  concept  for  harvesting  wind  energy  using  tethered  flying  devices.  Compared  toconventional wind turbines AWE systems require substantially less support structures like a tower.  The replacementof towers by tethers also allow accessing higher altitudes where winds blow stronger and more persistent.  Severalconfigurations are currently pursued.  Electricity can be generated with on-board propellers which are driven by the airflow and the power is transmitted to the ground through a conducting tether. Another configuration is the pumping cyclein which case the kite flies crosswind to pull a tether that is unreeled as it moves a ground-based electrical generator, anda retraction phase when the kite is reeled in. Next to electricity generation AWE can also be used for ship propulsion. We consider a single cell of a ram-air wing in our study which is based on an inflatable double skin design.  Ram-air wings are inflated by the stagnation pressure entering through inlets at the leading edge. The internalpressure provides structural stability and stiffness.  The fully or partially inflated structure is flexible and can thereforeexhibit large deformations during flight.  This introduces a strong coupling between the structure and the air flow sincethe internal pressure in dependent on the wind speed, and a deformed kite will inevitably have a different pressure fieldcaused by the flow compared to an un-deformed kite. Also, bridle system induces a significant additional drag to the wingdrag and therefore the kites fly with high angle of attack to obtain high lift and to ultimately maximise power output. Highangles of attack causes the flow to separate which cannot be simulated with fast inviscid methods and therefore a CFDanalysis tool such as OpenFOAM is required.The main challenge in analysis and design of these kites is the governing fluid-structure interaction (FSI) mechanism,which leads to a drastic increase in model complexity. On the other hand utilising FSI is crucial to obtain reliable results. on  performance  measures  and  structural  integrity.   We  follow  the  partitioned  coupling  approach,  where  the  fluid  andstructure domains are solved individually and coupled at their interface. In this work we couple OpenFOAM with ourfinite element (FE) solver mem4pyby using the coupling tool preCICE. The coupled solver is then used to simulate asingle ram-air wing section (cell) and its change in aerodynamic performance due to deformation.},

  abstract  = {Multiple-kite airborne wind energy (AWE) systems are typically characterized by unstable and highly non-linear dynamics which often translates to intricate controller design and challenging coordination problems. Rotary kite AWE systems (RAWES) have been alternatively proposed for small-scale applications, under the assumption that they can reduce the complexity of the control problem. This paper confirms that a small, rigid-wing RAWES in pumping mode can be controlled effectively in a large operational range, using only pitch control as on-board actuation. Optimal control is applied to compute RAWES pumping trajectories in different operating regions, for a design geometry that is optimized for a rated wind speed under structural constraints. The reduced control complexity comes at the cost of a low harvesting factor, close to that of conventional wind turbines.},

A characteristic feature of the various conversion concepts discussed is the use of tethered flying devices to substantially reduce the material consumption per installed unit and to access wind energy at higher altitudes, where the wind is more consistent.

The introductory chapter describes the emergence and economic dimension of airborne wind energy. Focusing on âFundamentals, Modeling & Simulationâ, Part I includes six contributions that describe quasi-steady as well as dynamic models and simulations of airborne wind energy systems or individual components. Shifting the spotlight to âControl, Optimization & Flight State Measurementâ, Part II combines one chapter on measurement techniques with five chapters on control of kite and ground stations, and two chapters on optimization. Part III on âConcept Design & Analysisâ includes three chapters that present and analyze novel harvesting concepts as well as two chapters on system component design. Part IV, which centers on âImplemented Conceptsâ, presents five chapters on established system concepts and one chapter about a subsystem for automatic launching and landing of kites. In closing, Part V focuses with four chapters on âTechnology Deploymentâ related to market and financing strategies, as well as on regulation and the environment.

The book builds on the success of the first volume âAirborne Wind Energyâ ([Springer, 2013](http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-39965-7)), and offers a self-contained reference guide for researchers, scientists, professionals and students. The respective chapters were contributed by a broad variety of authors: academics, practicing engineers and inventors, all of whom are experts in their respective fields.},

In this paper we compute the region of attraction (ROA) of path-stabilizing feedback gains around a periodic trajectory as typically flown by a power generating kite. The feedback gains are obtained from applying a time-varying periodic Linear Quadratic Regulator to the system expressed in transversal coordinates. To compute the ROA we formulate Lyapunov stability conditions which we verify by Sum-of-Squares programs. These programs are posed as an optimization problem for which we compare various definitions of the cost function representing the size of the ROA. In a numeric case study we demonstrate that the maximization of an expanding ellipse inside of quartic Lyapunov functions leads to significantly larger verified ROAs compared to the standard approach of optimizing over the scaling of the sublevel set of a quadratic Lyapunov function.},

The method consists of an optimization problem in which transverse contraction conditions are verified via sum-of-squares programs. The optimization approach can be used either to maximize the bounds on the allowable parameter uncertainty or to maximize the size of the region of contraction (ROC) given a fixed level of uncertainty. In a case study we apply the procedure to an Airborne Wind Energy system where the flight path of a power generating kite is controlled by a linear quadratic regulator based on a model which is prone to large parametric uncertainties. We consider periodic trajectories of the stabilized kite system and transform the dynamics into transversal coordinates for simplification of the controller design and reduction of the computational cost. The numerical results of the proposed optimization show that uncertainty in the steering gain parameter decreases the size of the ROC while uncertainty in wind speed or line length within the considered range of operating conditions does not affect the size of the robust ROC.},

In this way, when using the Real-Time Iteration scheme, variables associated with such stages can be efficiently eliminated from the quadratic subproblems by a single backward Riccati sweep. After eliminating the tightened stages, a quadratic problem with a reduced horizon is solved where the original constraints are used. The solution is then expanded to the full horizon with a single forward Riccati sweep. By doing so, the online computational burden associated with the solution of the optimization problems can be largely reduced. Numerical results are reported where, using the proposed scheme, a speedup of about one order of magnitude can be achieved without compromising closed-loop performance.},

Due to the limited computational power of the available hardware, a modified interior-point solver for the so-called partially tightened Real-Time Iteration is used. The algorithm splits the prediction horizon in two sections. A Riccati-like recursion is exploited that relies on a single linearization of the complementarity conditions per sampling-time for the terminal section. In this way, it is possible to achieve a speedup of a factor 3 with respect to a standard real-time iteration formulation for the application under consideration. Simulation results that show the improvement in performance obtained by using NMPC over standard control techniques are discussed and experimental results using the proposed implementation are presented.},

  abstract = {Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines for Embedded Optimization (BLASFEO) is a dense linear algebra library providing high-performance implementations of BLAS- and LAPACK-like routines for use in embedded optimization and small-scale high-performance computing, in general. A key difference with respect to existing high-performance implementations of BLAS is that the computational performance is optimized for small- to medium-scale matrices, i.e., for sizes up to a few hundred. BLASFEO comes with three different implementations: a high-performance implementation aimed at providing the highest performance for matrices fitting in cache, a reference implementation providing portability and embeddability and optimized for very small matrices, and a wrapper to standard BLAS and LAPACK providing high performance on large matrices. The three implementations of BLASFEO together provide high-performance dense linear algebra routines for matrices ranging from very small to large. Compared to both open-source and proprietary highly tuned BLAS libraries, for matrices of size up to about 100, the high-performance implementation of BLASFEO is about 20--30% faster than the corresponding level 3 BLAS routines and two to three times faster than the corresponding LAPACK routines.},

Newton-type optimization relies on a numerical simulation method in addition to the propagation of first or higher order derivatives. In the case of stiff or implicitly defined dynamics, implicit integration schemes are typically preferred. This paper proposes a tailored implementation of the necessary linear algebra routines (LU factorization and triangular solutions), in order to allow for a considerable computational speedup of such integrators. In particular, the open-source BLASFEO framework is presented as a library of efficient linear algebra routines for small to medium-scale embedded optimization applications. Its performance is illustrated on the nonlinear optimal control example of a chain of masses. The proposed library allows for considerable speedups and it is found to be overall competitive with both a code-generated solver and a high-performance BLAS implementation.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an extension of the simulation code ASWING to aeroelastic analysis of an airborne wind turbine. The device considered in this study consists of a tethered rigid wing with onboard-mounted wind turbines designed for wind energy harvesting in crosswind flight operation. The electrically conducting tether is deployed from a ground station and represented as a linear elastic spring with stiffness, mass, and frontal area emulating the properties of the real tether. The tether splits into several bridle lines to distribute the load transfer from the wing and to some degree also constrain its roll motion. The comparatively short bridle lines are considered to be inelastic with insignificant mass and aerodynamic drag contributions. The simulation model is validated by wind tunnel tests of a simplified scale model of the bridled wing. The comparison of computed and measured dynamic aeroelastic response shows that the tether force and the geometry of the bridle line system can strongly influence the flutter speed of the wing. In a final step, the simulation model is used to analyze the divergence, control reversal and effectiveness, and flutter behavior of a next-generation large-scale airborne wind turbine. The results confirm the significant influence of the geometry of the bridle line system on static and dynamic aeroelastic phenomena. It is concluded that classical methods used for suppression of aeroelastic instabilities can be applied to bridled wings only if this influence is taken into account.},

  abstract = {Wind tunnel testing of large deformable soft kites for wind energy conversion is expensive and in many cases practically not feasible. Computational simulation of the coupled fluidâstructure interaction problem is scientifically challenging and of limited practical use for aerodynamic characterization. In this paper we present a novel experimental method for aerodynamic characterization of flexible membrane kites by in situ measurement of the relative flow, while performing complex flight maneuvers. We find that the measured aerodynamic coefficients agree well with the values that are currently used for flight simulation of soft kites. For flight operation in crosswind maneuvers during which the traction force is kept constant, the angle of attack is inversely related to the relative flow velocity. For entire pumping cycles, the measurements show considerable variations in the aerodynamic coefficients, while the angle of attack of the kite varies only in a narrow range. This finding questions the commonly used representation of aerodynamic coefficients as sole functions of the angle of attack and stresses the importance of aeroelastic deformation for this type of wing. Considering the effect of the power setting (identical to the trim) solely as a rigid-body pitch rotation does not adequately describe the aero-structural behavior of the kite. We show that the aerodynamic coefficients vary as functions of the power setting (trim) of the kite, the steering commands and the flight direction.},

  abstract = {Airborne wind energy is an evolving renewable energy technology with the potential to reduce material as well as energy investments and to harvest wind resources that have so far not been accessible. Ground generation systems use the pulling force of a kite to generate a linear traction motion driving a drum connected to a generator. To understand and quantify the aerodynamic performance of a soft kite we developed a sensor system that measures the relative flow conditions on a flying, highly flexible wing. Together with ground-based measurements of traction force, the aerodynamic efficiency of the kite can be computed. The experimental data can be used for the validation of currently available kite models.
The lift-to-drag ratio is mainly affected by the power setting or trim of the kite and the steering commands. For the first time the effect of the trim control on the kite's steering capability was quantified for a leading edge inflatable kite. We found that a trim position with higher power ratio which results in a higher angle of attack increases the steering agility of the kite. The attained yaw rate increased by 40%. For optimization of future power kites it is important to understand the mechanisms affecting a kite's performance.},

Even though the physical foundations of the various conversion concepts are well understood, the actual economic potential of distributed small-scale and centralized large-scale power generation under realworld conditions is still under investigation. In the present chapter we consider the clustering of units into a large kite wind park, specifically the spatial arrangement and collective operation. The analysis starts from a quasi-steady flight model of the kite to estimate the power production in pumping cycle operation. From the surface area and aerodynamic properties of the kite all other system parameters are determined. A genetic algorithm is used to optimize the operation of a single unit and to derive its power curve. Based on this information multiple interconnected units are simulated and an economic model is added. The results show that a coordinated collective operation not only achieves a continuous net electricity output, but also decreases the LCOE from 106 to 96 â¬/Mwh as consequence of economic scale effects. The prediction supports the substantial economic potential of pumping kite wind parks for large-scale power generation.},

This chapter extends a dynamic system model to account for a realistic, turbulent wind environment and adds a flight path planner using a sequence of attractor points and turn actions. Path coordinates are calculated with explicit geometric formulas. To optimize the power output the path is adapted to the average wind speed and the vertical wind profile, using a small set of parameters. The planner employs a finite state machine with switch conditions that are highly robust towards sensor errors. The results indicate, that the decline of the average power output of pumping kite power systems at high wind speeds can be mitigated. In addition it is shown, that reeling out towards the zenith after flying figure eight flight maneuvers significantly reduces the traction forces during reel-in and thus increases the total efficiency.},

In this chapter, we investigate the role of airborne wind energy systems in the airspace and possible aviation-related risks. Within this scope, current operation permit details for several prototypes are presented. Even though these prototypes operate with local permits, the commercial end-products are expected to fully comply with international airspace regulations. We share the insights obtained by Ampyx Power as one of the early movers in this area. Current and expected international airspace regulations are reviewed that can be used to find a starting point to evidence the safety of airborne wind energy systems.

This hypothesis was confirmed based on a kite power system model extended from Loyd's model. The performance of small-scale and utility-scale kites in monoplane and biplane configurations were examined for increasing lift coefficients. Moreover, several parameters of the utility-scale system were optimized with a genetic algorithm. With an optimal lift coefficient of 4.5, the biplane outperformed the monoplane. A 40 m wing span kite was expected to achieve a rated power of about 4.1 MW with a power density of about 52 kW/m2. A parameter sensitivity analysis of the optimized design was performed. Moreover, to demonstrate the feasibility of very high lift coefficients and the validity of a utilized simplified airfoil polar model, CFDs of a proposed high-lift multi-element airfoil were performed and the airfoil polars were recorded.

Two PI controller designs are discussed: the classical PI controller with constant parameters and a nonlinear PI controller with online parameter adjustment. Based on a worst-case analysis of the physical properties, bounds on the constant parameters of the classical PI controller are derived leading to a conservative design to assure a stable operation also during the reel-in phase where the system dynamics are non-minimum phase. To overcome these limitations in the closed-loop bandwidth, a nonlinear PI controller is proposed which adjusts its parameters online. For controller design, the linearized system model is used and the controller parameters are computed via âonline pole placementâ. Simulation results illustrate robustness, stability and improved control performance of the proposed nonlinear PI controller in comparison to the classical PI controller.},

Important research efforts have been deployed to develop prototypes in order to test the technology, generate control algorithms and optimize the efficiency of AWE systems. By today, a large set of control and optimization methods is available for AWE systems. However, because no validated reference model is available, there is a lack of benchmark for these methods. In this paper, we provide a reference model for pumping mode AWE systems based on rigid wings. The model describes the flight dynamics of a tethered 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) rigid body aircraft in form of differential-algebraic equations, based on Lagrange dynamics. With the help of least squares fitting the model is assessed using real flight data from the Ampyx Power prototype AP2. The model equations are smooth and have a low symbolic complexity, so as to make the model ideal for optimization and control. The information given in this paper aims at providing AWE researchers with a model that has been validated against flight data and that is well suited for trajectory and power output simulation and optimization.},
