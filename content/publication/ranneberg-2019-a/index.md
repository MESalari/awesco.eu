abstract: " Viscous–inviscid interaction is the fastest method in computational fluid dynamics available for airfoil design and analysis that is able to capture viscous effects on the flow. Despite advances in (Reynolds-averaged) Navier–Stokes equations solvers and models, it is arguably the first choice for preliminary and even detailed design. A new method of coupling the boundary-layer equations to the inviscid flow is presented. The boundary-layer equations are solved with given displacement thickness, and a Newton method couples the viscous and inviscid regimes. This leads to a significant decrease in computational effort as compared to a joint solution of the boundary-layer equations with the coupling problem. The software Viiflow uses this mechanism, and examples that couple the integral boundary-layer equations with a panel method are presented: assessing accuracy using wind-tunnel measurements, using the software for a fluid–structure interaction problem, and a runtime performance comparison demonstrating a significant improvement as compared to the popular viscous–inviscid interaction airfoil analysis software XFOIL for higher numbers of panels."
