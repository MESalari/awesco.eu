abstract: "In this paper, direct interconnection of offshore pumping-mode AWE systems has been investigated. Direct interconnection is an approach to reduce the installation of power electronic sub systems in the field because of the high expenses of repair and maintenance for offshore systems. An offshore AWE park with three units has been modeled and simulation results and discussion are presented."
