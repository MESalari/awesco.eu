abstract: "In  this  work,  we  show  how  to  couple  OpenFOAM  (foam-extend)  and  MBDyn softwares  withpreCICE coupling tool to form a strongly coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) frameworkfor  membrane  structures   We  use  an  already  existing  preCICE  adapter  for  foam-extend  and  wedevelop an adapter for MBDyn in this work  The coupled FSI framework is verified by carryingout a simulation on a modified cavity test case which has a flexible membrane at the bottom of thedomain  The results are compared with the results of other authors The solvers and the couplingtool are introduced here briefly"
