abstract: "Multiple-kite  Airborne  Wind  Energy  Systems  (MAWES)  aim  to  decrease  inter-mittency  and  cost  over  conventional  wind  turbines,  while  generating  more  power  than  otherairborne wind energy systems The purpose of this work is to estimate whether axial and angularinduction are relevant phenomena in the modelling of pumping-cycle MAWES with two or morekites  Considering  the  modelling  assumptions,  axial  induction  is  a  relevant  phenomenon  andleads to significant changes in design-point, especially with respect to kite mass and secondarytether length However, angular induction can be neglected in modelling for optimal design andcontrol problems"
