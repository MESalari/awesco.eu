Airborne Wind Energy technology still faces many challenges before its commercialisation.
One of these challenges lies in the reliability of the operation, in terms of safety, predictability,
robustness and the desired behaviour of the system. ESR13â€™s work aims at extending robust
control analysis methods to dynamically uncertain systems under periodic operation. This
directly addresses the control of tethered wings in the power generation phase. The
addressed research fields include dynamic modelling, limit-cycle stability theory, optimization
and robust control. The focus lies in particular on the stability analysis of both nominal as well
as uncertain system.
